2.7 Intersection:
	Given two (singly) linked lists, determine if two lists intersect. Return
	the intersecting node. Note that the intersection is defined based on 
	reference, not value. That is, if the kth node of the linked list is the
	exact same node (by reference) as the jth node of the second linked list,
	then they are intersecting.
