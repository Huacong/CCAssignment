/*
1.6 String Compression:
	Implement a method to perform basic string compression using the counts of 
	repeated chracters. For example, the string aabcccccaaa would become 
	a2b1c5a3. If the "compressed" string would not bcome smaller than the original
	string, your method should return the original string. You can assume the 
	string has only uppercase and lowercase letters (a-z).
